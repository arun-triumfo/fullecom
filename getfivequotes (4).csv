Walls are constructed using the individual stud technique on a wooden or aluminum frame, which is then covered with wood-based material and finished with plaster, painted white. It is crucial to ensure that the walls are even and that the joints of the boards, as well as their attachment to the structure, are invisible. Other execution techniques are permitted as long as the final aesthetic effect is maintained. 
We would appreciate Your quotation tomorrow if possible.

I'm reaching out to get started on the booth design for our upcoming event, NRF2025 in NYC, and wanted to share our initial ideas and requirements. While we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have all the specifics yet, hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a rough outline of what weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re envisioning.
Booth Overview:
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢	Size: We are exhibiting at booth 3127, which is a 40x20 ft booth. 
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢	Layout concept: We want an open booth design, with KOAMTAC as the lead exhibitor. The booth will also feature three co-exhibitors, each with their own dedicated area. Please refer to the attached diagram for more details.
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢	Look and feel: With four companies sharing one booth, cohesion is key. KOAMTAC is the lead exhibitor, and our designs prominently feature black and lime green. We want to incorporate the co-exhibitors into the space seamlessly, without it looking out of place. To unify the booth, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re considering using a sloganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ÂTBD, but possibly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSmart Accessories for Smart Devices.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â We will design the graphics internally.

Regarding the materials used for the construction, please get back to us with some ideas. As you can see, the whole stand was dark and the lighting was not sufficient, therefore we want to change it by using brighter colors for the construction and better lighting  solutions.

We are a manufacturer of designer radiators and towel rails. Our factory is in Izmir, and we have an independent distributor company in Germany.

We kindly request your stand design proposals and price offers, as well as references, that align with our corporate image, highlight our brand and products, and offer spacious product display areas.

Our products: https://www.lojimax.com.tr/en/products.

Would it be possible to provide two proposals?:

1)	Standard
2)	Multi-use, that we can store and reassemble for future exhibitions. For example, think of cubes that can interlock like Lego piecesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âsomething we can use repeatedly, with perhaps just a repaint for future fairs.
?	Suitability for displaying over 100 radiators.
We believe that diagonal planes, as shown in the image, are more suitable for showcasing additional products.
?	A mini closed meeting area 
?	The area should be spacious enough for visitors to navigate comfortably.

Thank you in advance.

Our booth consists of an outer area with approximately 30 counters. In the center of the stand, we provide around 15 small tables with chairs. Along the wall shared with the neighboring booth, we have a storage area, where in addition to storing various materials, we also set up a small kitchen, as we offer food during the exhibition. Along the walls of the booth, there are cabinets for additional storage as well as three elegant wine coolers for white and sparkling wines..

Concept: 
Our Activation Zone is an education of Vulnerable vs Malicious components. There's a big gap in knowledge about the differences between the two and the severity of malicious components. We have two different activations set up to demonstrate the difficulty in determining which is which. One will be through the use of different flavored jelly beans and the other will be between two different boxes and what is within them.

Design:
The arches on either side will be divided into two sides Vulnerabilities and Malware. Then we will have two stations or activations.

I have sent across visual deck for an activation zone we similarly did in the US but we are also open to new design elements.

We will provide all the furniture, decoration, and accessories ourselves.
However, to give you a clearer picture, I am adding the details below (What we have, what we exactly want etc.):
Stand Dimensions:
Our stand is a shared stand, and we will be using half of an island stand measuring 11m x 14m.
We are requesting a dividing wall that is 11m long and 3.5m high.
So, our total space will be 11m x 7m.
We intend to keep the other sides open for both easy access and better product display.
Storage/Private Room Request:

We need a private room attached to the 11m wall.
It should be placed exactly in the center of the 11m wall, leaving 4m on each side.
The dimensions of the room should be 3m x 2.5m with a height of 3.5m.
The door should face the front, because we will be placing our bag-drop products in front of both side walls of this room.
The rest of our products will be positioned along the open sides of the stand, keeping them as aligned as possible.

Raised Flooring Request:
We require a raised floor, but it is crucial that we can pass electrical and internet wiring underneath it.
All of our products will need electric connections at their positions.
We haven’t decided on the exact placement yet, but we plan to position our products close to the edges of the stand.
Our bag-drop products will be positioned on both sides of the storage room.
Additionally, since we are requesting a minimum raising of 5 cm, we must comply with the expo authority’s requirement for an accessible ramp for people with disabilities.

We Do Not Require Any Furniture or Accessories:
We do not need any additional furniture or accessories.
However, to help with your design planning, here is a list of the furniture we will bring ourselves:
•	2 IKEA Docksta tables (75 cm height, 103 cm diameter, white color): IKEA Docksta
•	8 IKEA LIDÅS chairs (4 per table, white/chrome finish): IKEA LIDÅS
•	1 LCD screen (55 inches)
•	A reception counter (160 cm wide, 70 cm deep, 105 cm high, white, suitable for digital printing) (We don't have its photo)
•	For the inside of the storage room, we will bring our own coat rack, table, coffee machine, chair etc.
Our Products' Dimension:
(Width: W, Depth: D, Height: H)
•	Mobile Port: 45W × 38D × 165H cm
•	InfoKiosk: 56W × 106D × 130H cm
•	BagDrop1: 233W × 130D × 150H cm (We plan to position this on both sides of the privacy room wall, which is why we request the privacy room to be 2.5 meters deep.)
•	BagDrop2: 233W × 130D × 150H cm (Same as above)
•	Check-In Kiosk PGS: 59W × 52D × 180H cm
•	Check-In Kiosk-W-THY: 60W × 65D × 180H cm
•	Check-In Kiosk Old-THY: 40W × 40D × 140H cm
•	Check-In Kiosk SunExpress: 60W × 65D × 180H cm
•	OneID MonitorEye: 60W × 65D × 180H cm
(9 products we estrimate)

11m Wall Material:
Since the wall can be covered the with digital printing, we need the most affordable secure material available.
The required dimensions are 11m long and 3.5m high.
Logos and Stand Location:
I have attached two versions of both the Quavis and Emse logos, as we would like both to be visible. (Because, Quavis is a division company of Emse)
Stand location: Hall 10, Booth: 1521 - Quavis → Stand Layout
I have also attached images of a previous stand (PTE-23) that we built ourselves. Since the way we arrange our products will be similar, it might help for reference.
Additionally, I included our product brochure and images of a kiosk photo from an airport that is not included in the brochure.
After calculating all the costs for the exhibition, we have seen very high total expenses, so our priority is to keep this as cost-effective as possible.
Summary of Our Request:
•	1 private room (3m x 2.5m) positioned centrally along the 11m wall
•	1 wall (11m long x 3.5m high)
•	1 raised floor with an accessible ramp and suitable for electrical & internet connections
We are looking forward to receiving your best and most realistic price offer.

We have a concept and we would like to focus on it when building the stand. 
We have created a 3D model of the furniture arrangement at our stand, so I hope this will make your task much easier (see the attachment to the letter) 
 
This year we are focusing on the topic of space, but not directly, but only indirectly. 
I've attached a reference of the stand, but please don't take it literally, we just want to convey the atmosphere. 
 
Moreover, we would like to place a photo zone on one of the walls.
Can you tell me what options you can offer? I've also attached references to the letter that you can use.
Maybe a purple foil background and something like light bulbs or garlands to make it look more interesting (but I also want it to be neat and not get out too much) 
 
We would also very much like you to offer us various options of the ceiling design. 
Last year, we made a hanging LED screen, and it really attracted the attention of the guests.
Can we also do something high above our heads this time so that it stops the gaze of passing people? 
Maybe you can suggest some options suitable for our theme, or something luminous that can also attract visitors?

I hope this message finds you well.

I am Marta, from Genoray EU. 
A manufacturer of medical x-ray equipment.

I am reaching out to request your expertise in designing and constructing our booth for the upcoming EUSOBI 2025 exhibition in Aberdeen.

Below are the details and some comments for our EUSOBI 2025 booth:

• Booth Size: 12 m2 (6x2m).
• Ceiling/Lighting: It is recommended to install enough light in the booth.
• Device to be displayed: X-Ray Mammography device: Main Body + Console Unit (attached you could find the dimensions) + Remote workstation (for this monitor and PC is needed a table that protrudes/comes from the wall - that is fixed - with the following dimensions approx: 64 cm width x140 cm length and 100 cm height)

To give you a reference, we’ve attached a picture of a similar booth idea. 
In it, you could see a device display part, a counter-desk and a ""meeting"" area with a functional table. 
We would like to ask for a similar design, adjusted to the new requirements of this booth.

I kindly ask you for an initial design proposal and an estimated cost for the project.

Please feel free to reach out if you need further details or clarification.

We look forward to your ideas.

We are a European company exhibiting at the Field Service Palm Springs event from April 20-24, 2025, and we are exploring booth options. Our graphic design is nearly complete, and we are looking for a cost-effective solution—ideally within a $1,000-3,000 budget. 

Booth Specifications
-Size: 2.4 m (Width) x 6 m (Background Wall Length) = (8' x 20')
-TV Screen: Do you provide this service? If so, what are the available options and pricing for renting this TV of i.e. 42'' or 46''?
-Carpet: We would like a carpet in anthracite or grey. Can you provide this, and at what cost?  

Cost-Effective Options
-If there are more budget-friendly solutions, such as setups without LED lighting, please include those as well.
-In case renting is also a cost-effective option VS purchasing the booth please let me know.

Design
-We already have a design ready and can share it with you for printing.

Deadline & Setup
-Could you confirm the deadline for submitting the design to ensure the booth is ready in time?
-Our goal is to have everything on-site by April 20, 2025 in the early morning, so we can set up the booth on that day.
-Would you also be able to deliver everything at the event location here on the above date as we will be flying from Europe.

I'm uploading estimate we've already received. We're a production agency in Argentina, our main goal is to produce it in Prage (shipping from here is really expensive, which is why we can't use this contractor). 

The booth has to accommodate everything that's on the file. Screens, furniture, booth production + technical guards. 

Last few slides are regarding wall materials.

Booth will be happening in the Prague Congress Centre, for reference. 

Please let me know, we're looking forward to receiving your estimates!

Thanks a lot!
